// 1. What is Angular ??
// => Angular is frontend Javascript framework.
// => It helps with building interactive, mdoern web user interfaces.
// => Its also a collection of tools and features which contains CLI, debuggin tools and IDE plugines

// 2. Why use a framework and why angular ??
// => A framework simplifies the process of building complex, interactive web user interface and application.
// => With Angular, we can write declarative code as compare to imperative code which write in javascript.
// => Maybe for Trivial websites and webapps we don't need to use a framework
// but that changes when our apps gets biggers and more complex.
// => When working with angular, we build custom elements which are also called Components.
// => These components are generally comprised/made related to one UI section/component of the page.
// => Components are basically are combination of markup, styles and logic in a File made to solve one simpler problem and these components are reusable in different phases of the application.
// => Another crucial features of angular is that, it embraces some of the OOPs principles in the framework.
// => Note: Angular uses Typescript and not vanilla Javascript.

// 3. Code Writing Styles -
// => Imperative Code writing - In this type of code writing style, we write code in a step-by-step instructions
// (in code) that will tell the browser what to do.
// For Eg -
// 1. Find Dom element and store it in a variable.
// 2. Add event listener to that element.
// 3. In triggered function: Find another element.
// 4. Set CSS visibiltiy of that elment to 0.
// 5. Create a new p Dom element.
// 6. Set the text content of the p element to "hello world!".
// 7. Find element into which this p element should be inserted.
// 8. Insert p element and so on...

// => Declarative Code Writing - In this type of code writing style, we just define the target UI states and how
// they changes and let Angular do the rest.
// For Eg -
// 1. Manage "activeTab" state property.
// 2. Depending on the "activeTab", show different content.
// 3. Change "activeTab" upon click on tab element.
